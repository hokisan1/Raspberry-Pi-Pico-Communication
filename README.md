# Raspberry-Pi-Pico-Communication
I want to Communicate between Three Raspberry Pi Pico W using SPI protocol. 
I have used SPI communication to communicate between the three Raspberry Pi Pico W.
On the hardware I have connected MISO to MISO , MOSI to MOSI and SCK to SCK of each device to that of master. 
I have used GPIO 16 and 17 as slave select for slave1 and slave2 respectively.
I have also used GPIO 13 as slave select for each slave.
